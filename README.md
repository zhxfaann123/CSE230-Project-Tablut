# CSE230-Project-Tablut
A boarder game for CSE230 at UCSD

Team member: Xiaofeng Zhao

Language   : Haskell

**Project Proposal:**

This project aims to build an ancient boarder game called "Tablut", which is an variant of Tafl games. For more detail of this game, please see [Wiki for Tafl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafl_games). 

We will be implementing several functions beside the game itself. Tentative functions to realize are as follows:

1. Save and Load Game
2. Time limit for each turn
3. Notification for next move
4. (some AI players?)
